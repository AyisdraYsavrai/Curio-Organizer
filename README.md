# Lusternia Plugins


Curio Organizer:

        MUSHclient port of Pejat's mudlet plugin. 

        See the original thread (forums.lusternia.com/discussion/2147/mudlet-curio-organizer) for details. This port has the same limits has the original.


Mapping Miniwindow:
        
        Takes the IG map and moves it into a moveable miniwindow.
        Requires IG map to be on (CONFIG MAPVIEW ON) to work. 
        
        
Esteem to Essence:

        This gives you how much your figurine is worth.
        Probing the figurine will give you the worth and the bonuses being used.
        
        Use 'SESTEEM (TATTOO|REALM|POTEEN) <number>' to set these bonuses.
        
        Tattoo uses weight, realm uses essence from inlfuencing one realmmob, and poteen uses '.5'.
        You will need to reset poteen to 0 after it runs out.
        
        The system uses the formula found at: http://forums.lusternia.com/discussion/comment/38341/#Comment_38341
        As such, SupplicantsPrayer is not part of this total. It also does not take in account for any affinity penalty.
